# Sonic Emacs
My simple Emacs 30 Configuration

I would say it is less like an IDE and more like an Integrated Learning Environment, it has good support for Literate Programming, flashcards and clozes, LaTeX writing, Zettelkasten, all integrated.

# Other recommendations

- Use PARA mode structure: PARA stands for Project (a thing you work for a "short" amount of time), Area (a thing you constantly work with), Resource (something that you may use and change, like a book or manual), Archive (old files you probably will not edit). You can create folders and organize your org files in PARA folders, it will not change org-roam's web, since it auto detects all the files and backlinks. While web view is great, PARA allows for hierarchical structure alongside web view.
- 1d systems are humanly readable, 2d systems can represent better: some engineered languages like Unker Non-Linear Writing System (https://s.ai/nlws/) are 2d, and words and phrases branch off increasing the number of routes to read exponentially, just like a concept map, while human prose writing is 1d from left to right, it is much simpler to follow.
- Create a TODO node: By creating a TODO node you can link any TODOs in org-roam nodes to the TODO node, this avoids mixing org-agenda with org-roam, this is similar to how Logseq deals with TODOs.
- If packages are not installing: run M-x package-refresh-contents
